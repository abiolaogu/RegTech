# RegTech Horizon: Product Documentation

## 1. Product Overview
**RegTech Horizon** is the premier compliance automation platform for the Nigerian and US markets. It unifies data from fragmented sources (ERPs, Spreadsheets, Sensors) into a single "Source of Truth," enabling real-time regulatory reporting and proactive risk management.

## 2. Key Capabilities
### 2.1 Multi-Jurisdictional Reporting
- **NCC (Nigeria)**: Automated generation of Quality of Service (QoS) and Financial Health reports.
- **FCC (USA)**: Streamlined Form 477 filing and Universal Service Fund (USF) calculations.
- **CBN (FinTech)**: Real-time AML transaction monitoring and suspicious activity reporting (SAR).

### 2.2 "Three-Cs" Assurance
Our proprietary logic engine guarantees data integrity:
1.  **Completeness**: Ensures no required fields are missing before submission.
2.  **Correctness**: Validates data against 500+ regulatory rules (e.g., "Levy cannot exceed 2.5% of Revenue").
3.  **Consistency**: Cross-checks data across different report types for discrepancies.

### 2.3 AIOps & Predictive Alerts
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flags unusual spikes in transaction volume or network downtime.
- **Self-Healing**: Automatically corrects common formatting errors (e.g., phone number normalization).
- **Explanation**: Contextual NLG narratives explain *why* a metric is flagged (e.g., "Revenue dropped 15% due to 48hr outage in Lagos region").
